### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Caleb**](https://www.calebbrown.dev), a software engineer in the United States currently enrolled at Auburn University.

I mainly work with React/Typescript but im experienced with quite a few languages like Go, Swift, C#, etc. I'm a Unity Certified Game Developer even if I don't use the certification for anything. I work for the RFID Lab at Auburn University and collaborate with GS1, Walmart, Nordstrom, Dick's Sporting Goods, and other companies on their RFID implementations. Most of my projects are proprietary and under the @AU-RFID organization.
